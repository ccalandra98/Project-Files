This repository contains programs I wrote for a course I took, Image Processing and Computer Vision. It is Python code for various image processing and manipulation projects.

Some examples are:

-Image Thresholding
-Geometric Image Manipulation
-2D Filtering
-Text Recognition
-Histogram Adjustments
-Corner Detection (Harris Method)
-Polynomial Image Remapping
-Bilateral Filtering
-1D Array Fourier Processing
-2D Image Fourier Reconstruction
